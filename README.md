# AI-FinalProject
This project tackles the notorious Rush Hour game using breadth first search, A* and simulated annealing algorithms.

1.	The main method for the project is in ./src/project/AppRunner.java
2.	A graphical user interface will be launched and is used to visualize, run search algorithms and view metrics
3.	Along side the GUI, a log of moves and and metrics are displayed in the console.

## Running the code:
4.	Simply select a parking lot orientation from the dropdown list
5.	Select a search algorithm
6.	Select "Solve" to the solve using a desired algorithm
7.	To visualize the vehicle moves, select "Show"
8.	The metrics are constantly updated to reflect the parking orientation and algorithm chosen.
